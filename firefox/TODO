- use radio type simple-pref for language selection when it becomes available in the
  next version of the sdk (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=710107)

- possibility to undock the panel (overlay webpage)

- bug: CTRL-A and check on languagetool.org and you'll get Javascript code checked.
  "Text" in between <script>...</script> should probably be ignored.

- if you select a headline and the following paragraph you'll get an error because
  LT doesn't consider the paragraph

- make "http//localhost:8081" configurable

- using the plugin on Swiss text is confusing, as the language detection
  will probably return de-DE, thus there will be quite a lot of spelling
  errors (example: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich). Same for other
  variants.
