- password fields (type="password") should probably not be send to the server at all,
  for privacy reasons and because it doesn't make sense anyway

- possibility to undock the panel (overlay webpage or sidebar, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=787395)

- possibility to apply a suggestion

- bug: CTRL-A and check on languagetool.org and you'll get Javascript code checked.
  "Text" in between <script>...</script> should probably be ignored.

- if you select a headline and the following paragraph you'll get an error because
  LT doesn't consider the paragraph (use html instead of text property?)

- using the plugin on Swiss text is confusing, as the language detection
  will probably return de-DE, thus there will be quite a lot of spelling
  errors (example: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich). Same for other
  variants.

- checking text in text fields which are in an iframe cannot be checked without
  selecting the text (e.g. lt forum) - this probably affects all TinyMCE-based
  editors

- possibility to (de)activate rules

- possibility to add ingored spelling errors to persdict.dat

- translate the language name shown in the popup

- instant apply new shortcuts
