- password fields (type="password") should probably not be send to the server at all,
  for privacy reasons and because it doesn't make sense anyway

- possibility to undock the panel (overlay webpage)

- bug: CTRL-A and check on languagetool.org and you'll get Javascript code checked.
  "Text" in between <script>...</script> should probably be ignored.

- if you select a headline and the following paragraph you'll get an error because
  LT doesn't consider the paragraph

- make "http//localhost:8081" configurable

- using the plugin on Swiss text is confusing, as the language detection
  will probably return de-DE, thus there will be quite a lot of spelling
  errors (example: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich). Same for other
  variants.
