With this extension you can check text with the free style and grammar checker LanguageTool. LanguageTool finds many errors that a simple spell checker cannot detect, like mixing up there/their, a/an, or repeating a word, and it can detect some grammar problems. Moreover, it warns of typographical mistakes, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend">false friends</a> in foreign-language texts. LanguageTool supports <a href="http://languagetool.org/languages/">more than 25 languages</a>, including English, French, German, and Polish.

<b>Usage</b>

<ol>
<li>Select the text that you want to check, or click in a text field if you want to check its contents.</li>
<li>Click on the LT icon, which is displayed in the bottom right corner on the <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/kb/add-on-bar-quick-access-to-add-ons">add-on bar</a> by default, to have the text checked.</li>
</ol>

By default, the extension tries to use a locally running LanguageTool server. Download the stand-alone version of LanguageTool from the <a href="http://languagetool.org/">LanguageTool website</a> and either run <code>java -cp LanguageTool.jar org.languagetool.server.HTTPServer</code>, or open LanguageToolGUI.jar with Java, enable the server in the preferences, and keep the program running. Alternatively, you can enable the web service in the <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/kb/extensions-add-features-to-firefox#w_how-to-change-extension-settings">settings of the add-on</a> (please read the privacy policy linked above).

LanguageTool tries to auto-detect the language of the text; nevertheless, you should set a sensible fallback language in the settings of the add-on. Furthermore, a mother tongue must be set in order to get warnings about false friends.

If you want to move the LT icon to another place, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the add-on bar at the bottom of the browser window.</li>
<li>Select “Customize…”.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the icon to wherever you want.</li>
<li>Click on “Done”.</li>
<li>You might want to close the add-on bar by clicking on the close icon on the left.</li>
</ol>

<b>Known Issues</b>

<ul>
<li>It is not possible to check texts on websites which were loaded before the installation of the extension.</li>
<li>If you select a headline and the following paragraph, you might get a warning about wrong case because LanguageTool doesn't consider the paragraph. It might also happen that the last word of the first paragraph and the first word of the second paragraph are joined together.</li>
<li>“Text” between <script>-HTML-tags is checked, if it is part of the selection.</li>
</ul>
